If you’ve moved into a new home, you should secure the locks quickly. The main decision is whether to rekey or replace.

## Rekeying: when it makes sense
Rekeying keeps your existing hardware and changes the internal pins so old keys no longer work. It’s often faster and more cost‑effective.

## Replacing: when it’s the better choice
Replace locks if they’re worn, damaged, or you want upgraded hardware or smart lock compatibility.

## Practical decision guide
- Choose rekeying if the locks are in good condition
- Replace if you want upgraded security or better hardware
- Combine both if you have a mix of new and older locks
