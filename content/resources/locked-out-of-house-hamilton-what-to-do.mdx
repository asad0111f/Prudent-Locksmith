If you’re locked out of your home, safety and speed matter. Use this quick guide to avoid damage and get inside quickly.

## First, check for safe alternatives
- Confirm all doors and windows are locked
- Check with a trusted neighbor or property manager
- If you have a spare key in a secure lockbox, use it

## Avoid common mistakes
- Don’t force the door; you can damage the frame
- Don’t break a window unless safety is at risk
- Avoid DIY picks that may damage the lock

## When to call a locksmith
If you can’t access a safe spare key, call for professional entry. We use non‑destructive methods whenever possible.
