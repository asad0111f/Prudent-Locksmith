If your garage door won’t open, a few safe checks can reveal whether it’s a quick fix or a same‑day service call. Use the steps below and stop immediately if anything looks unsafe.

## 1. Check the power source
Make sure the opener is plugged in and the breaker hasn’t tripped. If the opener lights are off, power is likely the issue.

## 2. Inspect the photo sensors
Wipe the sensors and ensure they’re aligned. A misaligned sensor can stop the door from moving.

## 3. Listen for a motor or click
If the opener hums but the door doesn’t move, the belt, chain, or connection may be compromised.

## 4. Look for a broken spring
A snapped spring often makes a loud bang and leaves the door very heavy. Do not lift the door if a spring is broken.

## 5. Check the wall control
Try the wall button (not the remote). If the wall control works, the remote may need reprogramming.

## 6. Check for a manual lock
Some doors have a slide lock inside the door. If it’s engaged, the opener won’t lift the door.

## 7. Look for track obstructions
Debris or a bent track can prevent the door from moving smoothly. Avoid forcing the opener.

## When to call for emergency help
If the door is stuck closed, a spring is broken, or you hear grinding noises, it’s time to call for same‑day service.
