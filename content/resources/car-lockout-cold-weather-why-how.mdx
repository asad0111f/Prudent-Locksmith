Cold temperatures can cause locks and seals to behave differently, leading to unexpected car lockouts. Here’s why—and what to do.

## Common cold-weather causes
- Frozen lock cylinders or seals
- Battery issues that disable key fobs
- Keys left inside while warming the car

## What to do next
- Avoid forcing the door or window
- Use a safe, warmed key if available
- Call for mobile vehicle entry if the lock won’t respond
