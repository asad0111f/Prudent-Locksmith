App-enabled garage door openers add convenience and security, but they’re not for everyone. Here’s a quick guide to help decide.

## Benefits of app-enabled openers
- Open and close from anywhere
- Receive alerts if the door is left open
- Provide temporary access to family or deliveries

## When upgrades make sense
Upgrade if your opener is older, unreliable, or lacks modern safety and security features.

## What installation involves
We confirm compatibility, install the upgrade or new opener, and walk you through setup and security.
