A broken garage door spring is a safety issue. If you hear a loud bang and the door won’t lift, a spring likely failed. Here’s what to do next.

## What a broken spring sounds like
Most homeowners describe a sudden, sharp bang from the garage. After that, the door may only open a few inches or not at all.

## Why you should not force the opener
An opener isn’t designed to lift the full door weight. Running it with a broken spring can damage the motor or bend the rail.

## Safe steps to take
- Stop using the opener
- Keep people and vehicles clear of the door
- Call for a same‑day spring replacement
