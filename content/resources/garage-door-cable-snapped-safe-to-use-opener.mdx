If a garage door cable snaps, the door can become unbalanced and unsafe. Using the opener in this condition can cause more damage.

## Why a snapped cable is risky
The door can tilt or bind, putting extra strain on the opener and track. It may also drop unexpectedly.

## What you should do
- Stop using the opener immediately
- Keep vehicles and people clear of the door
- Call for cable repair or replacement
